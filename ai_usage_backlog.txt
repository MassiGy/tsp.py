AI USAGE BACKLOG::Massiles GHERNAOUT.

I've used AI today to:
* write the gen_instance_files.py.
* help me debug the redhog routine. It is chatGPT that helped me with the ordering logic (it suggested to order them in decending order.)
* I've used chatGPT to write the hubs visualiser.
The rest was all done by hand.
