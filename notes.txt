About the POIs, the ameneties that I've tested and found interesting for our implementation of the TSP variant are:
- charging_station
- toilets
- pharmacy




Note: I consider an amenity interesting if the nodes that represent it are not already clustered in one spot, otherwise our 
redhog algorithm will reduce the graph to only a handfull nodes...Which might be not enough.
So I've tested a couple ameneties, and I note the ones that do not have all the nodes in the same region.

As an example, restaurant or bar is a bad amenity since most of the restaurants in Le Havre are by the beach/down town.
marketplace is also a bad amenity since there is not a lot of them (9 nodes, we need at least 20.)
Same thing for clinic, there are only 2 !! 


These have way too much nodes (> 300)
- parking
- bicycle_parking
